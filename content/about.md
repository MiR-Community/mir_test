This is my About page.

MiR Community hopes to provide a space of belonging and support for people who identify as underrepresented minority R useRs. We also want to provide opportunities for underrepresented minority useRs to contribute to the R community.

To promote the visibility and leadership of R users from marginalized races, genders, and the disabled community through community-led efforts that support professional development.
