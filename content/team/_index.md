- Accessibility Committee
  
  - The accessibility committee is focused on ensuring that MiR content is accessible to R users with disabilities and raising awareness of accessibility within this context to the broader R community. Examples of current efforts the committee is working on is writing documentation and creating workflows to ensure that webinars are accessible to R users with disabilities along with working on coordinating a TidyTuesday event focused on integrating elements to make code and data visualizations more accessible. 
  
- MiR Highlights Committee
  
  - The MiR Highlights committee focuses on highlighting a member of the MiR community and the work that they do through a series of blog posts. 
  
- R Studio Instructor Certification Training Committee

The committee recruits volunteers to give webinars on a topic of their choice and in exchange for their time, the committee will handle promotion of the event. This committee also checks the materials to ensure that it meets the MiR guidelines for webinar content.
  
- Website Committee
    - This committee works on the design, implementation, and maintenance of the MiR website to create a home for MiR blog posts, events, resources, and a member directory.
